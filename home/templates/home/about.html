          <p>Hey there! My name is Hugo Zhang and I am a chinese. I moved to the U.S. for studying computer engineering and programming. I made this personal blog web application to sharpen my web development skill. Sometimes I may also post blogs dicussing about knowledge or interesting things I saw or learned related to computer engineering. Feel free to leave comments and correct me if I am wrong!</p>
          <p>I'm an introvert person back in China. After I came to the U.S., I am really impressed by the confidence and optiministism that americans have when I talked with them. I want to assimilate American culture and I think the best way to do that is by making more friends and travelling a lot. I will post the places I've been with photos and pictures and write down my own feeling after been to that place as well as the next stop where I am planning to go. Welcome anyone who is interested in travelling and making new friends to join me! </p>
          <p>Currently, I'm planning to have a trip to Japan. If you are intersted in that, please take a look at <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="{% url 'home:joinme' %}">here</a>.</p>
